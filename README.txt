Project by: Cameron Kim and  Trentan Trahan

to run, start by opening the index.html file

There is no backend so commenting, saving recipies, and editing the profile does not actually work as it would if this was a real app
for the sake of simplicity we also had all the recipes link to the same recipe file. On a real app this would be grabbed from the backend and the page generated dynamically using a fontend framework
